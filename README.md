# Abstract   

## Background: 
Socio-economic development in low- and middle-income countries, such as India, is paralleled by a shift in disease burden from underweight to overweight due to changes in dietary environments and physical activity. Both underweight and overweight are manifestations of unhealthy weight status. We investigated changes in the prevalence of underweight, overweight, and combined unhealthy weight from 2015 to 2019 in India.    

## Methods: 
Using data from the nationally representative National Family Health Surveys (Round 4: 2015-16, Round 5: 2019-20), we estimated the prevalence of unhealthy weight in adult non-pregnant women and men ages 15-49 y for 29 states and 7 union territories. We created a state- and district-level Development Index, comprising eight indicators of human capital and standard of living, using principal component analysis. We report the changes from 2015-16 and 2019-20 of unhealthy weight, underweight and overweight (including obesity) prevalence at the district-level (n = 640) among women, by quintile of the Development Index.    

## Results:   
At the national level, total unhealthy weight was similar between 2015-16 and 2019-20 (women: 43.5% vs 42.7; men: 39.1% vs 39.1%, respectively). The prevalence of underweight decreased (percentage points; women: 4.2 pp, men: 4.0pp) and overweight and obesity increased (women: 3.4pp, men: 4.0pp). The number of states where the share of overweight exceeded underweight increased from 23 to 29 for women (266 to 368 districts), and 25 to 31 for men. Across districts for women, prevalent underweight decreased and prevalent overweight increased at all levels of the Development Index. The steepest decline in underweight (-5.98; 95%CI: -6.95, -5.01) occurred in the least developed districts, while the steepest increase in overweight occurred in the most developed districts (5.92; 95%CI: 3.46, 8.38). Total unhealthy weight decreased in the least developed Development Index quintile (-2.99%, 95%CI: -4.99, -0.99) and increased in the most developed Development Index quintile (4.61%, 95%CI: 1.66, 7.57).     

## Conclusions:   
Overweight has replaced underweight as the leading contributor to unhealthy weight in over 80% of states for men and women and 58% of districts across India. This pattern is present across the spectrum of socio-economic development.
